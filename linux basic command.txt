	  i.) to go level up use cd..
	       
		    $ cd../Desktop
	  
2.)  To create a file quickly in directory use 'touch' command
     
     $ touch java1.txt

3.) To copy a file use 'cp' command

     $ cp java1.txt  python1.txt 

                         // left one is original file & right the copy to be created.

4.) To rename the file use 'mv' command (move)

5.) To delete file use 'rm' command

    $ rm java1.txt

   A.) to delete every thing in directory including directory itself use 'rm -rf' command

    $ rm -rf ~/Documents

6.) To see the file names in given directory use 'ls' command

    $ ls ~/Documents

   a.) to see more detail view of each file use 'ls -1 ' command
   b.) To see hidden files  use " ls -la " command
   
7.) To write files to the standard output
   
    $ cat java1.txt                   //concatenate
    
    a.) To use cat to perform complex operation using piping use command 'grep'
   
         $ cat java1.txt | grep Thread

     b.) To do for large file we use

        $ cat /var/log/message | grep 'Java is oops language'	
		
      c.) To use over docker container , you can use grep to zero-in on only container you are interested in.

        $ docker ps | grep java-container

8.) To append the content of existing file use:

    $ echo "java is oops language" >> java1.txt	

9.) To find specific sub-directory inside directory use 'find'

     $ find . -name java1 
	 
10.) To check permission on a given file use 	 
	    
		$ ls -1 <file name>
      then, 
            -rw-r--r--
			
11.) To change permission on file 

    $chmod u=rwx, g=rx,o=r java1.txt

    Also, use
	  $ chown <your_user>:<your_group> java1.txt
		

12.) To search back through your command history and re-run a previous command use 'reverse-i-search' command. by initiating "ctrl+ r" from keyboard.

13.) To re-run a command to see for change logs use 'watch' & 'free'.
        
		$ watch -n 5 free -m

      a.) to see latest change use "tail" command
	  
	     $ tail /var/log/message
		                
						// but it only prints 10 lines 
        // to print more use 
       
            $ tail -f -n 100 /var/log/messages	
			
14.) to know what a command does 

      $ man <command>

15.)	  The 'df -h' command shows disk usage on your machine in a human readable format.
